<p><h3 style="color:rgb(180,26,145);">
Q1. What do you think of Lialina’s definition of the universal user? Do you think it is a useful category for understanding Schwulst’s argument advocating for individual websites over platforms?

<p><h3 style="color:rgb(180,26,145);">
Q2. What kind of computer user are you? Draw on concepts from Lialina’s text, and integrate a quotation in your answer. Make use of metaphor, if you can, to describe your experience online (à la Schwulst).

1. I believe Lialina's definition of a universal user is a valuable tool when understanding what a website/interface entails but more importantly, why we create and the weight of that action. Both Lialina and Schwulst describe this way of human expression through the web and how it is important to want to create for you then for something/someone else. Lialina describes the universal user as one who achieves their goals with no prior experience or cares for what application it delivers -simply using a device for their creative purpose to achieve whatever goals desired. Schwulst also argues how crucial individuality is on the web and how larger corporations have differing motives. These platforms allow the creator to formulate an entire world for themselves and others without feeling controlled into a right or wrong way of expression. Both authors illustrate a similar idea when discussing the major intent behind users and its purpose. An example of this statement is how both suggest how users should be engaged and involved without being guided by larger companies or businesses.

2. When reading Lialina's article on the subject, I believe I would fall under a universal user based on how I express my ideas on the web. For the most part, I am not preoccupied with devices or applications when pursuing an idea. I find enjoyment in simply writing down a thought or design for myself. I especially love going at my own pace and feeling in control of whatever i'm creating. I liked Schwulst’s "website as garden" and "website as plant" metaphors, as it illustrates how there is no rush or expectations in self-expression - only the ones you give yourself. Schwulst describes this expression as stability, as they quote in their article: "Plants remind us that life is about balance. It is nice to be outside working on your garden, just like it’s nice to quietly sit with your ideas and place them onto separate pages". There is something special in giving an idea time and space to grow, to then watch it flourish into (maybe) something more.
